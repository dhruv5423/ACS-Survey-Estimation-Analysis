## Instructions to Obtain the Data

In order to acquire the data used for our IPUMS research study, we first navigated to (https://www.ipums.org/). Once on the webpage, click on the "Visit Site" button under IPUMS USA. Next, click on the white "Get Data" button under CREATE YOUR CUSTOM DATA SET.

Once on the webpage used for selecting samples and variables, click on the blue "Select Samples" button on the left. On the USA Samples tab, uncheck the "Default sample from each year" checkbox, and then reselect the checkbox corresponding to 2022. Once selected, click the "Submit Samples" button; this will take you to the variable selection webpage.

On this page, navigate to the "Household" dropdown menu under Select Harmonized Variables, and select "Geographic." In the list of variables under Geographic Variables — Household, click the plus sign next to the "STATEICP" variable. Then, hover over the "Person" dropdown menu and select "Education." In the list of variables under Education Variables — Person, click the plus sign next to "EDUC."

In the Data Cart floating window, select "View Cart." On the Data Cart webpage, select the blue "Create Data Extract" button. On the Extract Request webpage, to the right of Data Format, click "Change" and switch the format to .csv. Finally, press the "Submit Extract" button at the bottom of the page.

On the Download or Revise Extracts webpage, find the extract you requested, and in the Download Data column, click "Download .csv." This will give you the data necessary to run the code for our analysis.

## Overview of Ratio Estimator Approach

We try to use the ratio estimators' approach to find total respondents for each state using information we have available.  We look at the number of total doctoral degree holders in California and compare it to the total number of respondents in California. We find there are about 61.74 times as many people compared to doctoral degrees in California. So, we simply multiply the number of doctoral degrees holders in each state by this ratio (61.74) to get our estimate of total respondents per state. The assumption is that other states would have similar ratios of PhD’s to total respondents. This approach is necessary if we only have doctoral data for all the states, but not total respondent data.


## Comparison of Estimated Totals and Actual Totals

### Explanation as to Differing Results:

Some states may get differing values due to differing state characteristics. We based our ratio on California, which has a large number of educational institutes that award PhD’s. California’s large academic and advanced labor market may also draw in a lot of PhD’s in comparison to a state like Wyoming, which has less incentive for PhD’s to live there. This differing state level trends may explain why we get close estimates for some states, but not for others. In Wyoming (Code 68)  we predict there to be a much smaller number of people (4445.125) than there actually are (5962) and this is because of this discrepancy in assuming there are much more PhD’s in Wyoming then there are, so we multiply by too high of a number. Other states also underestimate suggesting the same issue as Wyoming. Massachusetts (Code 03), has an overestimate of the number of people, this is likely because they have a higher ratio of PhD graduates in their total population. This makes sense given that they have some of the best research institutions in the world that attract PhD’s, so in Massachusetts our ratio is an underestimate.
