What do I do next to complete the assignment

You’ve made great progress with your code! The next steps for completing your assignment include:

1. Estimate the Total Number of Respondents Using the Ratio Estimator Approach
The main part of your assignment involves using the ratio estimator approach to estimate the total number of respondents with doctoral degrees in each state, and comparing this with the actual number of respondents from the dataset.

Here’s how you can approach the remaining tasks:

2. Calculate the Estimated Total Number of Respondents by State
You are provided the total number of respondents in California across all education levels (391,171). You can use this to estimate the number of respondents for other states by calculating the ratio of doctoral degree holders to the total respondents in California and then applying that ratio to the other states.

Here’s how you can calculate this in R:

r
Copy code
# Get total number of respondents in California (state code for CA is likely 06, but double-check)
total_CA <- 391171

# Find the number of doctoral respondents in California
doctoral_CA <- doctoral_by_state %>% 
  filter(STATEICP == "06") %>% 
  pull(Count)

# Calculate the ratio of doctoral degree holders in CA to total respondents in CA
ratio_CA <- doctoral_CA / total_CA

# Estimate the total number of respondents by applying the ratio to other states
# First, get the total number of respondents with doctoral degrees in each state
doctoral_by_state <- doctoral_by_state %>%
  mutate(Estimated_Total_Respondents = Count / ratio_CA)

# Display the table with estimated total respondents
doctoral_by_state
3. Compare Estimated Total Respondents to Actual Data
To complete the assignment, you need to compare these estimates with the actual number of respondents from the dataset. You’ll need to sum the total number of respondents in each state from your dataset.

You can use group_by and summarise again, but without filtering by EDUCD, to get the actual total number of respondents by state:

r
Copy code
# Summarize the actual number of respondents by state
actual_by_state <- data %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(Actual_Total_Respondents = n())

# Merge the estimated data with the actual data
comparison <- doctoral_by_state %>%
  left_join(actual_by_state, by = "STATEICP")

# Display the comparison table
comparison
4. Explain Discrepancies Between Estimated and Actual Values
After calculating the estimates and actuals, you should discuss potential reasons why the estimated values differ from the actual values. These could include:

Sampling variability: The ratio estimator is based on a specific subset (doctoral degree holders), which might not perfectly represent the entire population.
Non-representative data: The data for California may not be proportional to other states.
Model assumptions: The assumption that the ratio of doctoral degrees to the total population is the same across states could introduce error.
5. Finalize the PDF
Once your analysis and comparison are complete, write out your conclusions and explanations in the document. For example, under the Conclusion section, summarize the discrepancies you found and suggest potential causes.

6. Render the PDF
Once your analysis and report are complete, you can render the document to PDF by clicking the Render button in RStudio or using the following command:

r
Copy code
quarto::quarto_render("IPUMS_Doctoral.qmd", output_format = "pdf")
This will generate the final document for submission.

Additional Notes:
Be sure to thoroughly explain how the ratio estimator approach works, as it's a key part of your assignment.
Add code comments and explanations in your Quarto document to guide the reader through the analysis process.
Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with any part of the assignment!






You said:
I have this code creating a table for doctoral degrees by state, ran in R and hidden in my quarto document. How do I save this data and present it in a neat table
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To save and present your data in a neat table in your Quarto document, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Save the Doctoral Degree Data by State
You can save the table in a .csv file or any other preferred format, such as .rds (R data format), within your R script. Here’s how to save it as a CSV:

r
Copy code
# Save the doctoral data by state to a CSV file
write_csv(doctoral_by_state, "doctoral_by_state.csv")
This will save your data as a CSV file in your working directory, which can later be referenced or shared.

Step 2: Display a Neat Table in Quarto Using knitr::kable()
To display a neat table inside your Quarto document, you can use knitr::kable() or the gt package for more advanced formatting. Here’s an example using knitr::kable():

r
Copy code
# Present the data in a neat table in Quarto using knitr::kable()
knitr::kable(doctoral_by_state, 
             caption = "Doctoral Degree Holders by State", 
             format = "html") # Or "latex" if you're rendering to PDF
This will generate a simple and clean table directly in your document.

Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Formatting Using the gt Package
If you want to make the table look more sophisticated with advanced formatting, you can use the gt package. First, install it if necessary:

r
Copy code
install.packages("gt")
Then, format the table using gt:

r
Copy code
library(gt)

# Create a neat table with more styling options using gt
doctoral_by_state %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Doctoral Degree Holders by State",
    subtitle = "Summarized Count of Respondents with Doctoral Degrees"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    STATEICP = "State",
    Count = "Number of Doctoral Degree Holders"
  )
Step 4: Include the Table in Your Quarto Document
In your Quarto document, include the table generation inside a code chunk. You can set the chunk to display the table inline:

yaml
Copy code
## Doctoral Degree Holders by State

```{r}
# Displaying the table in the document
knitr::kable(doctoral_by_state, 
             caption = "Doctoral Degree Holders by State", 
             format = "html")  # Use "latex" for PDF output
perl
Copy code

Or, if using `gt`:

```yaml
## Doctoral Degree Holders by State

```{r}
# Display a formatted table using gt
doctoral_by_state %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Doctoral Degree Holders by State",
    subtitle = "Summarized Count of Respondents with Doctoral Degrees"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    STATEICP = "State",
    Count = "Number of Doctoral Degree Holders"
  )
This will produce a styled table inside your Quarto output.

Step 5: Render the Document
After adding your table to the document, render the PDF or HTML using:

The Render button in RStudio.
Or, the following R command:
r
Copy code
quarto::quarto_render("your_quarto_document.qmd", output_format = "pdf")
Let me know if you need further assistance formatting the table or rendering it into your final document!

I put this code in but when I render the pdf the table does not, what is the problem
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue with your table not rendering in the PDF is likely due to how the LaTeX engine (which renders PDFs) handles tables. kableExtra might require additional packages or special handling to format tables properly in a PDF output. Here's how you can resolve it:

1. Ensure LaTeX Compatibility
Make sure your environment supports the necessary LaTeX packages. You can specify in your YAML header to load the kableExtra package for LaTeX:

yaml
Copy code
output: 
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: ["kableExtra"]
2. Use kable without kableExtra for Basic PDF Output
If the extra formatting provided by kableExtra isn’t critical, you can use knitr::kable() by itself, which works well with LaTeX/PDF output. Modify your table rendering code as follows:

r
Copy code
# Simple kable without extra formatting for PDF compatibility
knitr::kable(doctoral_by_state, 
             caption = "Doctoral Degree Holders by State",
             format = "latex")
3. Ensure Your Table Fits within Page Width
If the table is too wide, kableExtra can help fit it into the PDF page, but you’ll need to add longtable or landscape for large tables. For instance:

r
Copy code
# Add kableExtra styling for LaTeX output with PDF support
doctoral_by_state %>%
  kbl(caption = "Doctoral Degree Holders by State", format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
This hold_position option ensures the table stays in place rather than floating in the document.

4. Load Required Packages for PDF
If you want to use kableExtra formatting for advanced styling, you'll need to ensure that necessary LaTeX packages (booktabs, longtable, etc.) are included. You can specify this in your YAML header like so:

yaml
Copy code
output:
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: ["booktabs", "longtable"]
5. Final Check: Render the PDF
Make sure to run the following command to generate the PDF after making these changes:

r
Copy code
quarto::quarto_render("IPUMS_Doctoral.qmd", output_format = "pdf")
Troubleshooting Tips:
If the table still doesn’t render correctly, try rendering your document to HTML first to ensure there are no issues with the table generation.
If you're encountering errors with the latex_options, you might need to install the appropriate LaTeX packages on your system.
Let me know if this works or if you encounter any more issues!






You said:
can you write the code i need to use the laplace method of ratio estimators to:

If I tell you that there were 391,171 respondents in California (STATEICP) across all levels of education, then can you please use the ratio estimators approach of Laplace to estimate the total number of respondents in each state.  (Hint: You can now work out the ratio between the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in a state and number of respondents in a state and then apply that ratio to your column of the number of respondents with a doctoral degree in each state.)

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To implement the Laplace method of ratio estimators and estimate the total number of respondents in each state, based on the given information (391,171 respondents in California across all levels of education), we can follow these steps:

Steps to Apply the Laplace Method of Ratio Estimators:
Calculate the ratio between the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California and the total number of respondents in California.
Apply this ratio to the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in each state to estimate the total number of respondents in each state.
Compare the estimated total number of respondents for each state with the actual number.
Here's the code to do that:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
data <- read_csv("/Users/dhgu2021/Downloads/usa_00001.csv")

# Step 1: Calculate the total number of respondents in California
# Filter data for California (STATEICP == 06 for California)
california_data <- data %>%
  filter(STATEICP == 06)

# Count the total number of respondents in California
total_respondents_california <- nrow(california_data)

# Step 2: Calculate the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California
doctoral_in_california <- california_data %>%
  filter(EDUCD == 116) %>%
  nrow()

# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of doctoral degree holders to total respondents in California
ratio_california <- doctoral_in_california / total_respondents_california

# Step 4: Estimate the total number of respondents in each state using this ratio

# Group data by state and count respondents with doctoral degrees in each state
doctoral_by_state <- data %>%
  filter(EDUCD == 116) %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(doctoral_count = n())

# Use the ratio to estimate the total number of respondents in each state
estimated_total_by_state <- doctoral_by_state %>%
  mutate(estimated_total = doctoral_count / ratio_california)

# Step 5: Display the estimated total respondents in each state
print(estimated_total_by_state)

# Step 6: Optionally save the results to a CSV file
write_csv(estimated_total_by_state, "estimated_total_by_state.csv")
Explanation:
Step 1: We filter the data for California (where STATEICP == 06), and then count the total number of respondents.
Step 2: We count the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California (EDUCD == 116).
Step 3: We calculate the ratio of doctoral degree holders to total respondents in California.
Step 4: We calculate the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in each state, and use the ratio from California to estimate the total number of respondents in each state.
Step 5: The estimated total number of respondents by state is stored in estimated_total_by_state.
Key Points:
This method assumes that the ratio of doctoral degree holders to total respondents in California is representative of the ratio in other states, which may not be entirely accurate but works for estimation purposes.
The estimated total number of respondents in each state is calculated by dividing the number of doctoral degree holders in the state by the ratio calculated for California.
Let me know if you need further adjustments or clarifications!

Conclusion
Summarize why the estimates may differ from the actual values, based on assumptions made during the analysis...

Key Changes and Cleanup:
Redundant filtering: The filtering for STATEICP == 71 (California) and EDUCD == 116 (doctoral degrees) was done once and used throughout.
Consolidation: I consolidated steps where possible, especially in filtering and joining data, to avoid repetition.
Removed extra steps: The additional filtering of doctoral_CA and ratio_CA is simplified into a single calculation where needed.
Table display: Used knitr::kable() with kableExtra to ensure the tables render neatly within the PDF document.
Let me know if this looks good or if you'd like further refinement!






You said:
The tables are still not displayinhg
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the tables are still not displaying in your PDF document when using Quarto, there could be a few reasons. Let's ensure you're using the right approach and verify a couple of steps. Here are some adjustments and troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the YAML Header
Make sure your YAML header allows for proper rendering. For example:

yaml
Copy code
---
title: "IPUMS 2022 ACS Analysis"
author: "Dhruv Gupta"
date: "2024-10-03"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    latex_engine: xelatex  # Optional, can help with certain formatting issues
---
2. Ensure Required Packages Are Loaded
Ensure the packages required for table rendering are loaded properly. Include the kableExtra package in your code chunk for tables:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
3. Adjust the Table Code
Make sure to print the tables explicitly after they are created. Here's an updated section of your Quarto document with explicit printing commands:

r
Copy code
# Display the table of estimated total respondents by state
estimated_table <- knitr::kable(estimated_total_by_state, caption = "Estimated Total Respondents by State") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

print(estimated_table)

# Display the comparison table
comparison_table <- knitr::kable(comparison, caption = "Comparison of Estimated and Actual Respondents by State") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

print(comparison_table)
4. Verify Rendering Process
Ensure you are rendering your Quarto document correctly:

In RStudio, make sure you use the Render button or use the command line:
r
Copy code
quarto render "your_document.qmd"
5. Install Required LaTeX Packages
If you are rendering to PDF and facing issues, ensure you have a proper LaTeX installation (e.g., TinyTeX, MiKTeX). You can install TinyTeX from R if it’s not installed:

r
Copy code
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
Complete Example
Here’s the complete section that should render your tables correctly:

r
Copy code
# Step 1: Filter Doctoral Degrees by State

```{r}

# Load data into RStudio
data <- read_csv("/Users/dhgu2021/Downloads/usa_00001.csv")

# Filter data for California (STATEICP == 71)
california_data <- data %>% filter(STATEICP == 71)

# Total number of respondents in California
total_respondents_california <- 391171  # Given value

# Number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California
doctoral_in_california <- california_data %>% filter(EDUCD == 116) %>% nrow()

# Calculate the ratio of doctoral degree holders to total respondents in California
ratio_california <- doctoral_in_california / total_respondents_california

# Group data by state and count respondents with doctoral degrees in each state
doctoral_by_state <- data %>%
  filter(EDUCD == 116) %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(doctoral_count = n())

# Estimate the total number of respondents in each state using the ratio from California
estimated_total_by_state <- doctoral_by_state %>%
  mutate(Estimated_Total_Respondents = doctoral_count / ratio_california)

# Display the table of estimated total respondents by state
estimated_table <- knitr::kable(estimated_total_by_state, caption = "Estimated Total Respondents by State") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

print(estimated_table)
Conclusion
After making these adjustments, try rendering your Quarto document again. If the tables still do not display, please provide any error messages or warnings that occur during the rendering process, as they might give more insight into the issue.

# Print the table
print(estimated_table)
4. Render the Document
Once you've included the print statement as shown above, render your document again:

In RStudio, use the Render button.
Alternatively, run the following command in your R console:
r
Copy code
quarto::quarto_render("your_document.qmd")
Important Notes
The print(estimated_table) command should be the last line of the code chunk that creates the table.
Ensure that you have the latest version of the kableExtra package and that it is correctly installed. You can install/update it using:
r
Copy code
install.packages("kableExtra")
Conclusion
This structure should allow the table to render correctly in your PDF. If you still cannot see the tables, please check the R console for any error messages during rendering, as they may provide additional insight into the issue.

Explanation of Changes
Read the CSV File: The comparison_data variable reads the comparison.csv file.

Display the Table: The kable function is used to format the comparison_data into a neat table.

Rendering: Ensure that the code chunk containing the table display is included in the final output by setting include: true.

Final Steps
After adding this code to your Quarto document, you can render the document again using the Render button in RStudio or by running the command:
r
Copy code
quarto::quarto_render("your_document.qmd")
This should display the comparison.csv table in your rendered PDF. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask!

To display only the table without showing the underlying code in your Quarto document, you can adjust the code chunk options. Here’s how you can do that:

Updated Code for Displaying the Table
You need to set echo: false in the chunk options to prevent the code from being displayed in the output. Here’s the updated section for displaying the comparison table:

markdown
Copy code
## Display the Comparison Table

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Read the comparison data from the CSV file
comparison_data <- read_csv("comparison.csv")

# Display the comparison table using kable
comparison_table <- knitr::kable(comparison_data, caption = "Comparison of Estimated and Actual Total Respondents by State") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

# Print the comparison table
comparison_table
Explanation of Changes
echo: false: This option prevents the code from being printed in the output, so only the table will be displayed.
include: true: This ensures that the chunk is included in the final document.
Final Steps
After making these changes, render your Quarto document again. The table should appear without any accompanying code, providing a clean presentation of your results.

If you have any more questions or need further adjustments, let me know!

Here is the qmd file that I have. Can you please edit it to clean up the names of the table. Additionally, I want to select certain rows to display in "comparison_table_sample" and have the entire table with the rest of the rows in an appendix.

## Overview of Ratio Estimator Approach

We try to use the ratio estimators' approach to find total respondents for each state using information we have available.  We look at the number of total doctoral degree holders in California and compare it to the total number of respondents in California. We find there are about 61.74 times as many people compared to doctoral degrees in California. So, we simply multiply the number of doctoral degrees holders in each state by this ratio (61.74) to get our estimate of total respondents per state. The assumption is that other states would have similar ratios of PhD’s to total respondents. This approach is necessary if we only have doctoral data for all the states, but not total respondent data.

## Explanation as to Differing Results:

Some states may get differing values due to differing state characteristics. We based our ratio on California, which has a large number of educational institutes that award PhD’s. California’s large academic and advanced labor market may also draw in a lot of PhD’s in comparison to a state like Wyoming, which has less incentive for PhD’s to live there. This differing state level trends may explain why we get close estimates for some states, but not for others. In Wyoming (Code 68)  we predict there to be a much smaller number of people (4445.125) than there actually are (5962) and this is because of this discrepancy in assuming there are much more PhD’s in Wyoming then there are. Similar discrepancies exist in other states based on how similar they are to California in their PhD to population ratios.

The error you're encountering typically occurs when the Quarto document (in your case, named IPUMS_2022_ACS_Analysis.qmd) is not found in the specified directory. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Check the File Name and Location:

Ensure that the filename is exactly IPUMS_2022_ACS_Analysis.qmd and that it is in the current working directory of your RStudio session. You can verify the working directory by running getwd() in the R console.
Set the Correct Working Directory:

If the file is located in a different directory, you can set the working directory to the location of your Quarto file using setwd("path/to/your/directory") before rendering. Replace "path/to/your/directory" with the actual path to your Quarto file.
Open the File in RStudio:

Make sure you have the Quarto file open in RStudio. You can do this by navigating to the file in the RStudio file browser and opening it.
Rendering the Document:

If you're using RStudio, you can render the document by clicking the "Render" button (or "Knit" button if you see that). Alternatively, you can run the following command in the R console:
r
Copy code
quarto::quarto_render("IPUMS_2022_ACS_Analysis.qmd")
Revised Quarto Document (if needed)
Here’s the complete Quarto document again for reference. You may not need to change it, but ensure the file is saved correctly with the following content:

To convert your Quarto document to a PDF, follow these steps within RStudio:

Steps to Render to PDF
Open the Quarto Document:

Make sure your .qmd file (e.g., IPUMS_2022_ACS_Analysis.qmd) is open in RStudio.
Check the YAML Header:

Ensure the YAML header at the top of your .qmd file specifies pdf_document. Based on your provided code, it looks good:
yaml
Copy code

title: "IPUMS 2022 ACS Analysis"
author: "Dhruv Gupta, Justin Klip, Kevin Shen"
date: "2024-10-03"
output: 
  pdf_document:
    latex_engine: xelatex 
---
Render the Document:

In RStudio, click on the Render button located in the toolbar (usually in the top-right corner of the script editor) or use the following command in the R console:
r
Copy code
quarto::quarto_render("IPUMS_2022_ACS_Analysis.qmd")
Check Output Location:

By default, the PDF will be saved in the same directory as your .qmd file. Look for a file named IPUMS_2022_ACS_Analysis.pdf in your project directory.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors during the rendering process, consider the following:

Install LaTeX:

Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed, as it's required for PDF output. Common distributions include:
TinyTeX: A lightweight LaTeX distribution that you can install via R. Run the following in your R console:
r
Copy code
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
MikTeX or TeX Live: Larger distributions available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Check for Missing Packages:

If you receive error messages about missing LaTeX packages during rendering, you may need to install those packages. Most LaTeX distributions will prompt you to install missing packages when you first render.
Examine Console Output:

Look at the R console output for any errors or warnings that may indicate what went wrong.
Example Quarto PDF Output
Assuming your code is error-free and all dependencies are met, the rendered PDF will contain the text, tables, and figures as defined in your Quarto document, formatted according to the specifications in your YAML header.

Let me know if you need any further assistance or specific adjustments!

In order to acquire the data used for our IPUMS research study, we first navigated to (https://www.ipums.org/). Once on the webpage, click on the "Visit Site" button under IPUMS USA. Next, click on the white "Get Data" button under CREATE YOUR CUSTOM DATA SET.

Once on the webpage used for selecting samples and variables, click on the blue "Select Samples" button on the left. On the USA Samples tab, uncheck the "Default sample from each year" checkbox, and then reselect the checkbox corresponding to 2022. Once selected, click the "Submit Samples" button; this will take you to the variable selection webpage.

On this page, navigate to the "Household" dropdown menu under Select Harmonized Variables, and select "Geographic." In the list of variables under Geographic Variables — Household, click the plus sign next to the "STATEICP" variable. Then, hover over the "Person" dropdown menu and select "Education." In the list of variables under Education Variables — Person, click the plus sign next to "EDUC."

In the Data Cart floating window, select "View Cart." On the Data Cart webpage, select the blue "Create Data Extract" button. On the Extract Request webpage, to the right of Data Format, click "Change" and switch the format to .csv. Finally, press the "Submit Extract" button at the bottom of the page.

On the Download or Revise Extracts webpage, find the extract you requested, and in the Download Data column, click "Download .csv." This will give you the data necessary to run the code for our analysis.

Following the steps above, we obtained geographical data regarding College Graduates, speicifically their state 

## Overview of Ratio Estimator Approach

We try to use the ratio estimators' approach to find total respondents for each state, given the fact that there are 391,171 respondents in California at all levels of education. We look at the number of total doctoral degree holders in California and compare it to the total number of respondents in California. We find there are about 61.74 times as many people compared to doctoral degrees in California. So, we simply multiply the number of doctoral degrees holders in each state by this ratio (61.74) to get our estimate of total respondents per state. The assumption is that other states would have similar ratios of PhD’s to total respondents. This approach is necessary if we only have doctoral data for all the states, but not total respondent data.

@tbl-laplace compares our estimates of doctoral degree holders with actual totals for relevant states. We display Massachussets (StateICP = 3), New York (StateICP = 13), Alabama (StateICP = 41), Arkansas (StateICP = 42), Wyoming (StateICP = 68), and California (StateICP = 71).

### Explanation as to Differing Results:

Some states may get differing values due to differing state characteristics. We based our ratio on California, which has a large number of educational institutes that award PhD’s. California’s large academic and advanced labor market may also draw in a lot of PhD’s in comparison to a state like Wyoming, which has less incentive for PhD’s to live there. This differing state level trends may explain why we get close estimates for some states, but not for others. In Wyoming (Code 68)  we predict there to be a much smaller number of people (4445.125) than there actually are (5962) and this is because of this discrepancy in assuming there are much more PhD’s in Wyoming then there are, so we multiply by too high of a number. Other states also underestimate suggesting the same issue as Wyoming. Massachusetts (Code 03), has an overestimate of the number of people, this is likely because they have a higher ratio of PhD graduates in their total population. This makes sense given that they have some of the best research institutions in the world that attract PhD’s, so in Massachusetts our ratio is an underestimate.

To remove variable names in the tables displayed by kable in your Quarto document, you can use the col.names argument in the kable function. Setting col.names = NULL ensures that no variable names (i.e., column headers) are displayed in the tables.

Here's your updated code with the variable names removed:

Explanation of Changes:
col.names = NULL: This argument ensures that column headers (variable names) are removed from both the sample and complete comparison tables.
kable Function: This change applies only to how the table is displayed and does not affect the underlying data.

To ensure consistent significant figures in your tables (specifically two decimal places), you can use the round() or formatC() function to format the numerical columns before passing the data to kable.

Here’s your updated Quarto code with formatting applied:

Explanation of Changes:
round() Function:

Used round() to limit numerical columns (doctoral_count, Estimated_Total_Respondents, and Actual_Total_Respondents) to 2 decimal places.
Applied round() directly within mutate() for cleaner, consistent formatting.
No Column Headers:

Set col.names = NULL to remove variable names.
Formatted for Tables Only:

The rounding applies specifically to the table display and does not affect how the data is saved to the CSV files.
Rendering:
Save this updated .qmd file and render it in RStudio using the Render button or run the following command in your R console:
r
Copy code
quarto::quarto_render("IPUMS_2022_ACS_Analysis.qmd")
This will produce tables with numerical values rounded consistently to two decimal places.
